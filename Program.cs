// NOTES: I finally got all of the unsent/pushed stuff erased. I went back through the phone program, and also looked at the GitHub programs that the others sent you. Once I saw where I made mistakes it was pretty obvious. One of the worst parts for me is not seing how a problem might be solved in the way you want it done, and then tripping along as I piece it together. Hopefully this one is much better. I did recieve the Gang of Four book tonight in the mail, and will continue to figur this all out as I move forward.
